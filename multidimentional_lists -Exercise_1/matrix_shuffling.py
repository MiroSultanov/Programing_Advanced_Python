# Write a program that reads a matrix from the console and performs certain operations with its elements. User input is provided similarly to the problems 
# above - first, you read the dimensions and then the data. Your program should receive commands in the 
# format: "swap {row1} {col1} {row2} {col2}" where ("row1", "col1") and ("row2", "col2") are the coordinates of two points in the matrix. 
#     A valid command starts with the "swap" keyword along with four valid coordinates (no more, no less), separated by a single space.
# •	If the command is valid, you should swap the values at the given indexes and print the matrix at each step (thus, you will be able to check if the operation
#    was performed correctly). 
# •	If the command is not valid (does not contain the keyword "swap", has fewer or more coordinates entered, or the given coordinates are not valid), 
# print "Invalid input!" and move on to the following command. A negative value makes the coordinates not valid.
# Your program should finish when the command "END" is entered.
